# Software Defined Networking (SDN) 
---
## What is SDN?
---
```Software-defined networking (SDN) is the concept of separating the data plane and control plane of a network, and implementing the control plane in software. The data plane is the part of the network that forwards packets, while the control plane is the part of the network that determines how to forward packets. The separation of the data and control planes allows the control plane to be implemented in software, which can be updated and changed more easily than hardware. The separation also allows the control plane to be implemented in a central location, which can be used to manage multiple data planes.```

## What is OpenFlow?
---
```OpenFlow is a protocol that allows a controller to communicate with a switch. The controller can send messages to the switch to tell it how to forward packets. The switch can send messages to the controller to tell it about the state of the switch.```

- Management Plane or Infrastructure Plane

## Benefits of SD-WAN
---
-  The top benefits of SD-WAN are its higher capacity bandwidth, centralized management, network visibility, multiple connection types.
- SD-WAN technology allows organizations to use cheaper connection types than MPLS.
- An organization can change the type of WAN connections being used as traffic volumes change.
- There is a considerable initial investment required when deploying a new end-to-end SD-WAN, but over time, there are also considerable savings.
