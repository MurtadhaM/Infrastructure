### Database
``
A database is a collection of data that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated. A database is typically controlled by a database management system (DBMS). The DBMS provides various functions that allow entry, storage and retrieval of data in the database. A database is usually organized to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information, such as (for example) modelling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies.
``
### Data Warehouse

``A data warehouse is a system used for reporting and data analysis, and is considered a core component of business intelligence. Data warehouses are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. They store current and historical data in one single place for creating analytical reports for business intelligence.``

### Data Lake

`` 
A data lake is a system or repository of data stored in its natural/raw format, usually object blobs or files. Data lakes enable the storage of data of any type, size, and ingestion speed. The data is not processed or transformed in any way before being loaded into the data lake. Data lakes are designed to store all the data collected by an organization, whether it is structured or unstructured, and to enable analytics on that data.
